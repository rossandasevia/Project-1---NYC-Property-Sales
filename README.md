# NYC-Property-Sales EDA & Correlation

# Project Goals

The goal of this project is to apply EDA to property sales in NYC to extract insights into its data such as:

1. Compare mean sale prices across different boroughs
2. Identify the most common property type and tax class
3. Compare property units (total, residential, and commercial) across different boroughs in NYC
4. Identify areas with the largest property Gross Square Feet and Land Square Feet in NYC

And to examine correlations between sale price and other factors.

# Project Conclusion
1. Of all the regions, property in Manhattan is the most expensive property compared to the other boroughs, exceeding the average property price in NYC.
2. The most common building class category in NYC is family dwelling, where family dwelling occupies the top 3 most building classes in NYC and the most in each borough.
3. In line with the number of family dwellings building class, the most common tax class type is class 1 which includes most residential properties of up to three units (such as one-, two-, and three-family homes and small stores or offices with one or two attached apartments), vacant land that is zoned for residential use, and most condominiums that are no more than three stories.
4. The largest Gross Square Feet and Land Square Feet in all of NYC is in the boroughs of Queens by a significant difference compared to the largest Gross Square Feet and Land Square Feet in other boroughs.
5. Factors that affect the selling price of the property selling price in NYC are most affected by Gross Square Feet, followed by residential units, and total units. Commercial units and Land Square Feet hardly affect the selling price of the property.
